crush the 20 oreos into the mixer (you can even remive the cream of it if want and can keep it). grind it to fine substance. you can also add 1/2 cup sugar to it if needed.
remove this in a big bowl and add milk to it (approx 1 cup) slowly as and when needed to make the cake batter thick.
heat the oven for ten minutes at 180 degree celcius and if using the micrwave let be still.
add 1 tsp of baking soda and mix it well and put it in the oven and if using microwave put it in for 5-6 minutes..
Tada!! the cake is ready.... Do not demould it until and unless it cool down and comes to the room temp. or else it will break.
